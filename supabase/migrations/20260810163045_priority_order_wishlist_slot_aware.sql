-- Fixes a real regression discovered while investigating an unrelated
-- orphaned-row cleanup: generate_priority_order()'s wishlist CTE
-- (20260720165552_priority_wishlist_ranking.sql) has filtered
-- `ip.slot is null` since it shipped 2026-07-20. At the time every real
-- item's item_preferences row had slot = null unconditionally (only
-- placeholder/Other Sources rows carried an explicit slot), so the filter
-- was a no-op. Two later features started writing an explicit slot on real
-- items too -- Finger/Trinket disambiguation (#623, 2026-08-01) and the
-- Weapon/Off Hand dual-wield fix (#673, 2026-08-08) -- and neither updated
-- this function. Since then, any status a raider tags on a Finger 1/Finger
-- 2/Trinket 1/Trinket 2/Weapon/Off Hand item has been invisible here,
-- including 'pass' -- a raider explicitly passing on one of these items was
-- silently still eligible to be suggested for it.
--
-- Fix: match purely on item_id (drop the slot filter) and, since the same
-- item_id can now carry more than one row per player (one per disambiguated
-- row it's eligible for -- e.g. a one-hander tagged differently for Weapon
-- vs Off Hand, or a ring tagged independently for Finger 1 vs Finger 2),
-- collapse to the single best status per player via a ranked array_agg.
-- "Best" = most favorable to candidacy, matching the existing multiplier
-- order (bis 1.0 > good 0.90 > catalyst 0.75 > ok 0.60 > pass/excluded):
-- a raider who wants this item in *either* hand/finger/ring slot is still a
-- genuine candidate for it, and only a raider who passed on *every* row for
-- this item_id is excluded. Legacy slot=null rows (single row per item, the
-- only kind this filter used to see) are unaffected -- a group of one row
-- picks that same row.
